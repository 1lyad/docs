You might be wondering whether or not you should create an assistant using the `/assistant` endpoint with its `assistantId`. Or, can you just specify the assistant configuration when starting a call?

The `/assistant` endpoint is there for convenience to save you creating your own assistants table.

<Accordion title="Use cases">
- You won't be adding more assistant properties on top of ours.
- You want to use the same assistant across multiple calls.
</Accordion>

Otherwise, you can just specify the assistant configuration when starting a call.

## Variables

Prompts, messages, and other assistant properties can be dynamically set when starting a call based on templates.
These templates are defined using double curly braces `{{variableName}}`.
This is useful when you want to customize the assistant for a specific call.

For example, you could set the assistant's first message to "Hello, `{{name}}`!" and then set `name` to `John` when starting the call
by passing `assistantOverrides` with `variableValues` to the API or SDK:

```json
{
  "variableValues": {
    "name": "John"
  }
}
```

#### Default variables

By default, the following variables are automatically filled based on the current (UTC) time,
meaning that you don't need to set them manually in `variableValues`:

| Variable    | Description                    | Example              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `{{now}}`   | Current date and time (UTC)    | Jan 1, 2024 12:00 PM |
| `{{date}}`  | Current date (UTC)             | Jan 1, 2024          |
| `{{time}}`  | Current time (UTC)             | 12:00 PM             |
| `{{month}}` | Current month (UTC)            | January              |
| `{{day}}`   | Current day of month (UTC)     | 1                    |
| `{{year}}`  | Current year (UTC)             | 2024                 |
